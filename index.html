Orange is combination of red and yellow, a warm vibrant color with connotations of energy and flamboyance. It's less intense or aggressive than red. It gives the site a fun and bright appearance.
Green highlights the picture and gives the background a soothing and relaxing feeling it also represents the dial of the watch which has a green dial watch and will atrract more people as the color on the dial has a huge attraction or fanbase and is known as "Hulk" which resembles the color green.
